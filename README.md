# Keil-LEDBLINK
Build a LED blinking project on Keil Studio Cloud with NUCLEO-F401RE using Mbed OS. Utilized DigitalOut class to toggle the onboard LED connected to pin PA5. Demonstrated Mbed's high-level API for GPIO control, timing using ThisThread::sleep_for(), and structured C++ embedded development.
