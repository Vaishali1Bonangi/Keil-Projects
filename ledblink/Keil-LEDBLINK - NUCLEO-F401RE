~Keil-LEDBLINK - NUCLEO-F401RE (Keil Studio Cloud + Mbed OS)~
Demonstrate a LED blinking project on Keil Studio Cloud with STM32_NUCLEO-F401RE using Mbed OS. Utilized DigitalOut class to toggle the onboard LED connected to pin PA5. Demonstrated Mbed's high-level API for GPIO control, timing using ThisThread::sleep_for(), structured C++ and cloud-based development tools.

~Features~
Utilizes the onboard LED (LD2 on pin PA5) of the NUCLEO-F401RE board
Implements a simple delay using ThisThread::sleep_for()
Uses the DigitalOut class from Mbed OS for GPIO control
Cloud-based compilation and flashing via Keil Studio Cloud

Hardware Used:
Board: STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE
LED Pin: PA5 (LD2 â€“ green LED on the board)

Software Tools:
Keil Studio Cloud (https://studio.keil.arm.com/)
Mbed OS (online libraries)
Web Browser for development and flashing

How to Run a code:
Open Keil Studio Cloud
Create a new Mbed project and select your board as NUCLEO-F401RE
Copy the code above into main.cpp
Connect your board via USB
Click Build & Flash to deploy and run the code

What I have Learn?
